## Project Overview (DSA Animation)

This repository provides a comprehensive collection of interactive animations and educational resources focused on fundamental data structures and algorithms. The aim is to support students, educators, and self-learners in visualizing how essential data structures work, including their internal processes and operations. By leveraging visualizations, users can better grasp concepts such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching within structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

The resources are designed for use in computer science courses, workshops, and self-study, offering intuitive, step-by-step illustrations of complex algorithms and data manipulation. Whether you are new to data structures or seeking to reinforce your understanding, these materials provide a valuable supplement to traditional learning approaches.

All animations and resources are contributed by the University of San Francisco and are intended to advance open education and promote excellence in computer science instruction.
